## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
*   npm (usually comes with Node.js) or yarn
*   Python (v3.8 or higher recommended)
*   pip (Python package installer, usually comes with Python)
*   A Gemini API key from Google AI Studio (for all AI features)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd scribe-project-directory # Or your project's directory name
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    This installs dependencies for the React frontend, the Node.js server (video processing), and the Log server.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Python environment and install dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects.
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the Python backend directory
    cd src/backend

    # Create a virtual environment (e.g., using venv)
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    # source venv/bin/activate

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt 

    # Return to the project root directory
    cd ../.. 
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Open the `.env` file and add your Gemini API key:
      ```
      VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
      ```
    *Note: Supabase keys for the AI Chat persistence are hardcoded in `src/supabaseClient.js` and do not need to be added to the `.env` file for the application to run.*

## Getting a Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Navigate to the API keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key and paste it in your `.env` file as `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`.

## Running the Application

Scribe consists of multiple services. You can run them individually or use the concurrent script for convenience.

**1. Using the Development Script (Recommended):**

This script runs all necessary services concurrently: React app, Node.js server, Python FastAPI server, and the Log server.
```bash
npm run dev
```

**2. Running Services Individually:**

If you prefer to run services in separate terminals:

*   **React Frontend App:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Usually runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

*   **Node.js Server (for Video Processing & related APIs):**
    ```bash
    npm run server
    ```
    The server will attempt to run on port 8001 by default. Check server logs for the exact port if 8001 is in use. It updates `SERVER_PORT` in your `.env` file.

*   **Python FastAPI Backend (for Workspace, Editor AI, Chat AI):**
    ```bash
    npm run fastapi
    # OR directly:
    # cd src/backend && python main.py
    ```
    Usually runs on `http://localhost:8000`.

*   **Log Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run start:logs
    ```
    Runs on `http://localhost:9999`.

**Accessing Scribe:**

*   Once all services are running (or after starting `npm run dev`), open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
*   The Log Viewer can be accessed at `http://localhost:9999`.

## Centralized Logging

The application includes a dedicated log server to help track and diagnose issues across its different components.

### How to Start the Log Server

1.  Open a new terminal in the project root.
2.  Run:
    ```bash
    npm run start:logs
    ```
3.  The log server will start on `http://localhost:9999`.

### Viewing Logs

-   **Web Interface**: Open `http://localhost:9999` in your browser to see logs from various sources with auto-refresh.
-   **Raw Logs**: Access `http://localhost:9999/raw` for plain text logs (if supported by the log server).
-   **Log Files**: Log files for different components (e.g., `python.logs`, `nodejs.logs`, `worker.logs`) are stored in the `logs/` directory in the project root.

### Log Sources

The log server aggregates logs from:
- Python Backend
- Node.js Server
- Frontend (Worker/System)
- Filesystem operations
- Supabase interactions (if any are logged to this server)

Each log entry typically includes a timestamp, log level, message, and source.
